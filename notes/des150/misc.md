## vocabulary

Form
All visual elements constitute what we call Form. Form is not just a shape that is seen but a shape of definite size, color, and texture. 

Space
The space around an element or between elements in a visual composition.

Repetition
A recurring element in a design, either in composition or over time.

Rhythm
Movement is measured in time and repetition in groups.

Direction
Objects in a composition will always indicate a movement or a direction, except when they are centered. 

Texture
The visual or tactile surface characteristics and appearance of something. The illusion of a physical texture is a visual texture. 

Pattern
Pattern is a specific type of visual texture derived from repeated structures appearing in an organized graphic manner.

### motion

Time
Adding the element of time gives life to art, design, typography, logos, data, user interfaces, and spaces. This is how motion design differentiates itself from typical animation. In film, a frame is a single still image. The illusion of movement occurs when frames are shown in rapid succession. This is often referred to as the persistence of vision. This phenomenon occurs in the eye, where a frame’s afterimage is thought to persist for approximately 1/25th of a second on the retina. The next frame’s image overlaps this afterimage, and we interpret it as continuous movement.
 
 Transition/Transformation
 Transformation refers to the change in the graphics, the connection between the previous frame and the next one. If the transition is too rigid or disconnected, the fluency of the whole design will be reduced. Sometimes the most successful motion graphic expression does not depend on huge transformations or transitions. A simple transition or transformation can be more effective than a complex one.
