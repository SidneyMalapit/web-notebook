## descriptive vs inferential statistics

**descriptive** - describes a data set, is a summary

**inferential** - draws conclusions from a data set, predicts/infers

---

**population** - all individual items of a particular type

**sample** - a subset individuals of the population

---

## measures of location

**mean** - sum then divide by sample size, symbolized by bar over variable

**trimmed mean** - computed by taking away part of the largest and smallest of values in a set
(must be in sequential order)

**median** - based on sample size:\
    if odd, it's the value right in the middle\
    if even, take the mean of the two values in the middle
