# graphical displays of data

---

**dot plot**
- one dimensional

**scatter plot**
- two dimensional
- duplicated numbers next to each other

**stem-and-leaf plot**
- helps to visualize the shape of a distribution
- split each observation into two parts (stem and leaf)
- frequency - amount of leaves per stem
- bin size - size of each stem
- ex. stem and leaf plot split by integer and decimal
- can be rotated and turned into a frequency histogram
![example stem and leaf plot](stem-leaf-example.png "stem and leaf")

**histogram**
- relative frequency - freq. / sample size
- use the midpoint of each interval

**box-and-whisker plot** elements:
- box which contains
    - median (50%)
    - 25th percentile as lower extreme
    - 75th percentile as higher extreme
- interquartile range is the range between the lower and upper quartiles
- whisker
    - 1.5 times interquartile range
    - ex. iqr = 10, then whiskers 15 away from median
- outliers - unusually far from the bulk of the data

## other important measures

**skewness** (measure of asymmetry) - which side is the tail on?
- positive skew right, negative skew left
- direction of mean offset from median
- symmetric if mean = median

**kurtosis** (measure of tailedness) - how much data are in the tails?
- greater kurtosis - greater data in tails
- less kurtosis - less data in tails
